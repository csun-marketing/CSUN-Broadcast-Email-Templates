## Template Guidelines
The following is a best-practices checklist to review before sending your message:
* Ensure that overall spelling and grammar has been checked and approved
* Ensure that all non-email links use the ```target="_blank"``` attribute to trigger a new window to open when the user clicks a link
* Ensure that all URL&rsquo;s (links and images) are using absolute paths:<br>
**Correct**<br>
```http://www.csun.edu/marketing-and-communications/our-services```<br>
**Incorrect**<br>
```/marketing-and-communications/our-services```
* Ensure that there are no spaces before the ```http://``` protocol in any links
* Use HTML entity tags for any special characters (quotes, ampersands, em dashes, etc.). The following is a good resource to reference needed tags: https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/symbols/
* Ensure that the copyright year is correct
* Make sure you&rsquo;re using the correct department/college logo with the registration mark &mdash; a directory can be found here: http://www.csun.edu/ua/2017logos/
* Follow accessibility best practices by including descriptive alt-text for your images &mdash; the CSUN Universal Design Center has guidelines available here: http://www.csun.edu/universal-design-center/web-accessibility
